# Contributing

If you have found this page, chances are that you are considering to to contribute to this project.

Awesome!

This is a small, purely volunteer-driven project, so your contributions are _highly_ welcome.

## How to get started?

* Download an experimental live ISO from https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-desktop/wiki
* Look through the GitHub Issues sections of the projects within https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/
* A great way to get started is to comment on some GitHub issues. Also feel free to open new ones. We use GitHub Issues as a means of discussion and keeping track of everything, so don't hesitate to use them.
* Especially have a look at issues marked with ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2480569/97901371-64b8ad80-1d3c-11eb-8282-0bfdcd3fe512.png). Here your contributions would be especially helpful, but of course your contributions to other tickets are more than welcome, too
* There is a liberal amount of `FIXME` and `TODO` in the source code. Reducing the number of those is always highly welcome

## Our project values

* Please see https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-desktop for the general philosophy of the project
* Always keep in mind that our philosophy is "simple > complicated", "less, but better"
* We prefer small pull requests that change one thing each, rather than large ones that do many things at once
* We appreciate code with comments that explain why we are doing something
* Our policy is to merge PRs liberally but roll back changes that cause breakage quickly. `main` must always build and not crash
