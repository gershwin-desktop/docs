# Note to distributions

The Gershwin Desktop is under active development, and things change rapidly. Hence, it is currently not recommended yet to attempt packaging the Gershwin Desktop in a traditional way. Instead, the use of https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-build is highly encouraged for the time being.

Please do not hesitate to contact the team if you have questions regarding this policy.
