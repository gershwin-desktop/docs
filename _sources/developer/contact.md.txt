## Discussions

The Gershwin [Discussions](https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-desktop/discussions/) forum is a great place to interact with Gershwin users and developers. If you have questions, feel free to ask in "Q&A". If you are running Gershwin, we'd be happy to hear from you in the "Show and tell" section.

## Chat

You can also meet other Gershwin users and developers in the the IRC channel #Gershwin on  irc.libera.chat. In any case, _please stay in the channel for a few days_ and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers and come by only once in a while.
