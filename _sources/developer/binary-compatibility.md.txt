 # Binary Compatibility
 
Binary compatibility is an important concept in software engineering. It allows applications compiled on a build system to run on user's target systems without forcing them to upgrade their entire system all the time. As the FreeBSD wiki page on binary compatibility points out, "a lot of downstream users keep systems for about 10 years and want to be able to keep running their stack on top of FreeBSD without worrying that an upgrade will break things."

This page is in draft status and needs to be reviewed by experienced FreeBSD developers. Pull requests welcome.
